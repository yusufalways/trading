# üéâ PROFESSIONAL TRADING SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## üöÄ Major Accomplishments

### ‚úÖ Performance Tab Fixed
- **Issue**: Performance tab was showing fixed stocks instead of dynamic scan results
- **Solution**: Updated `show_charts()` function in `dashboard.py` to use `st.session_state.scan_results`
- **Result**: Performance tab now shows charts for stocks found in the latest scan

### ‚úÖ Critical Signal Contradictions Fixed
- **Issue**: RSI at 44.5 was marked "Neutral" instead of proper zone classification
- **Solution**: Implemented professional RSI interpretation with proper zones:
  - 0-30: Oversold (BUY_OPPORTUNITY)
  - 30-40: Oversold Zone (POTENTIAL_BUY)
  - 40-60: Neutral Zone (NEUTRAL)
  - 60-70: Overbought Zone (CAUTION)
  - 70-100: Overbought (SELL_WARNING)
- **Result**: RSI 44.5 now correctly shows "NEUTRAL" (neutral zone), not misleading "Oversold"
