# 🎯 Comprehensive Trading Plan & Strategy

## 📊 **Data Sources & API Strategy**

### **Free vs Paid APIs - My Recommendation: START FREE** ✅

**Free Data Sources (Sufficient for Learning & Paper Trading):**
- **Yahoo Finance** (via yfinance) - ✅ **RECOMMENDED START**
  - ✅ Historical data for all 3 markets (India, Malaysia, USA)
  - ✅ Real-time delayed data (15-20 min delay)
  - ✅ No API limits for basic usage
  - ✅ Perfect for backtesting and paper trading

**When to Upgrade to Paid APIs:**
- For real-time live trading (not needed for paper trading)
- For tick-level data (not needed for swing trading)
- For advanced fundamental data

**TradingView Integration:**
- Yes, possible through web scraping (selenium)
- But Yahoo Finance gives us the same OHLCV data
- TradingView better for charting, our system better for automated analysis

## 🎯 **Trading Strategy - Your Next Steps**

### **Phase 1: Paper Trading Foundation (Next 2-4 weeks)**

**Week 1-2: Setup & Historical Analysis**
1. **Collect Historical Data** (1-2 years for backtesting)
2. **Test Strategies** on historical data
3. **Generate Buy/Sell Signals** for current market
4. **Create Watchlists** for each country

**Week 3-4: Live Paper Trading**
1. **Daily Signal Generation** (run analysis each evening)
2. **Track Paper Trades** (simulate with real market prices)

## 📋 **Our Immediate Action Plan**

### **What You Need to Provide:**

4. **Time Commitment** (how often will you check/update?)

### **What I'll Build for You:**

        'india': analyze_indian_stocks(),
        'malaysia': analyze_malaysian_stocks(), 
        'usa': analyze_us_stocks()
    }
    return format_trading_signals(signals)
```

    if macd_bullish: score += 20
