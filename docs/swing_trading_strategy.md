# 🎯 Swing Trading Strategy: Support/Resistance Level Identification

## Problem with Current Approach
Your current strategy shows "top performing stocks" - but these are often **already extended** and not ideal for swing trading entries. 

## Better Strategy: Support/Resistance Scanning
Look for stocks that are:
1. **Near key support levels** (bounce potential)
2. **Near resistance levels** (breakout potential) 
3. **Have technical momentum** (RSI, MACD, volume)
4. **Good risk/reward ratios** (2:1 or better)
